          <h3>Manchester Of South India</h3>
          <p>
            Coimbatore is termed and often called as "Manchester of India" Or
            South India to be precise.<br />
            The city earns the tag owing to the overwhelming textile industry
            there. The cotton fields are a thing of beauty but the magic the
            weavers spin on garments is something else altogether.<br />
            Coimbatore has more than 25,000 small, medium and large industries.

          <h3>Siruvani - The Sweet Pride Of Coimbatore</h3>
          <p>
            It is claimed to be the World's second tastiest water, the first
            being Nile's. Scientist say the taste of the water is due to the
            mineral content present in it. <br />While many manufacturers of
            bottled water struggle to strike the perfect balance of minerals for
            the sake of the water’s taste and nutrient content, Siruvani water
            is found to have this ‘perfect balance’ by itself without the need
            for any improvisation.

          <h3>Kari Speedway</h3>
          <p>
            Coimbatore has a Formula 3 Auto racing circuit. How cool is that?
            This is one of the few circuits of the kind in the entire nation and
            not surprisingly Coimbatoreans are insanely proud of it, like a
            mother dragon would be proud of her baby who could fly way higher
            than any other dragons in the land. Only, with the Kari Speedway,
            it’s not flying but racing that catches your imagination-wheels
            spinning, heart pounding and sometimes stopping with all the
            excitement!
